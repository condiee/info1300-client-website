## Client
Your team must design and build a website for a client. You are strongly encouraged to have your client identified as soon as possible. You may wish to discuss this with 1300 staff well before the initial requirements from your client are due in Milestone 1. Please visit office hours rather than posting to Ed Dicussions for these conversations.

Your client may be any organization, on campus or off, that needs a website. Campus clubs, local businesses, Ithaca-area farms, etc. are all fair game. If those options aren’t appealing, you may choose to create a personal site for another person. Note that we generally discourage personal websites, however they are acceptable if they are elaborate and meet all project requirements.

You will need access to the client’s website’s audience for user interviews and user testing. When meeting with your client, you should discuss that you will need their help accessing members of the site’s audience.

Note: It is important that you choose a client that will be available for meetings as you will need to meet several times throughout the duration of the project to work out requirements, generate content, and get feedback. You will be required to meet with your client at least three times – first to talk about requirements and design ideas, second to show them your design sketches and get feedback, and finally to show the final version and create a plan for deploying (publishing) the website. More meetings may be useful for staying coordinated and getting buy-in. Emphasize to your prospective client the importance of these meetings and make sure they are on board.

## Choosing an external client
Our recommendation is to choose a client for which none of your team members have a direct, personal connection. You should not be your own client. Remember that designing a website requires you to design for the audience, not yourself. Taking yourself on as a client makes this far more challenging.

Note: You may choose a client where you are involved in a part of the organization, so long as the audience for the site is not you nor any of your team members.

## Project Overview
You will build a static, client-side only website. Your site design and implementation must directly reflect the material we have learned this semester. Your website is required to have substantial interactivity (use of JavaScript). You may use JavaScript to implement photo galleries, drop-down menus, etc. Anything that dynamically changes the page counts as interactivity.

There will be about 4 people per group working on this site, and you have about one month to work on it. This means we are looking for a site that is bigger than your previous projects. We will provide feedback to help you calibrate your project’s scope and make sure your site/design is neither too small nor too big.

Important! Web forms are prohibited in your group project. Many clients desire to have a form on their website: sometimes this is a contact form, or maybe it’s a sign-up for their newsletter. You need to know back-end web programming to implement a form. We only cover front-end web programming in 1300. If you wish to learn about back-end web programming, considering taking INFO 2300: “Intermediate Design and Programming for the Web” in the spring.

## Interactivity
In order to demonstrate your knowledge from this course, your site must include some original piece of substantial client-side interactivity using jQuery/JavaScript. This cannot be a form.

Examples from previous semesters include:

Dynamically changing content based on context such as the time, day, or location of access.
For example, a restaurant homepage might automatically show the current day’s specials based on the day of the week.
Or maybe show the breakfast menu first if breakfast is currently being served.
An interactive photo gallery.
Drop-down menus
Collapsible panels/sidebars
“Pop-up” panels/modals for some content.
Letting people search and/or sort content such as products, members of an organization, events, or other data relevant to the client.
(This is difficult to implement client-side, only pick this option if you’re a more experienced programmer and there’s a handful of things to search.)
Note: Your team must develop substantial interactivity from scratch (i.e., you can’t just copy something you found in some web tutorial).

## Existing Website
If your client already has a working website, you must design a new site that is substantially different from the original site. It is OK to take some of the same ideas/content that their current website uses and build on that, as long as you put in as much new work as other teams making a site from scratch.

# info1300-group-project 

## Project Overview
We designed and built a static, client-side only website for an on-campus organization, Fanclub Collective. We conducted user interviews and user testing with the client’s website’s audience to inform the site design. Using using jQuery/JavaScript, we built substantial client-side interactivity into the site to implement photo galleries, drop-down menus, and more.
